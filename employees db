-- i'm interested in finding out the average salary of each title grouped by gender.
-- i have tried several combinations of query but i still did't get the answer.

-- this interest arises when i use this code:

SELECT 
    t.title, e.gender, count(t.emp_no)
FROM
    titles t
        JOIN
    employees e ON e.emp_no = t.emp_no
GROUP BY t.title, e.gender
ORDER BY t.title;
